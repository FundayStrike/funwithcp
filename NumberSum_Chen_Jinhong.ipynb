        "Inspired by another The Devil's Plan game, Number Sum (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNuedzRh2O4), write Python code to generate a game for a player to form numbers summing up to a target integer k. A game flow is as follows:\n",
        "- display a 2D m by n grid of numbers. each number is between 1 and 9 inclusive.\n",
        "- when the player is ready (by pressing y), computer will replace the grid, 'hiding' the numbers with ascending alphabets A, B, C, ...\n",
        "- computer will generate a pseudo random up to 2-digit integer k\n",
        "- prompt the player to enter a sequence of i letters which associated numbers sum up to k. the sequence must be connected either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. for a start, you may assume i = 3.\n",
        "- if the sequence correctly sums up to k, player earns 1 point\n",
        "- if the sequence does not sum up to k, player loses 1 point\n",
        "- there can be more than 1 correct sequence that sums up to k. so prompt for input again.\n",
        "- game terminates when\n",
        "  - player has entered all sequences that sum to k\n",
        "  - it is impossible to form a sequence that sums to k\n",
        "  - player quits by entering -1  \n",
        "- when the game terminates, show all possible sequences that sum to k, or 0 if none.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may state reasonable assumptions for a minimum viable product. Have fun. :)"
